# ZipCodeRange
Given a collection of 5-digit ZIP code ranges (each range includes both their upper and lower bounds), this provides the minimum number of ranges required to represent the same restrictions as the input.


EXAMPLES:

If the input = [94133,94133] [94200,94299] [94600,94699]

Then the output should be = [94133,94133] [94200,94299] [94600,94699]


If the input = [94133,94133] [94200,94299] [94226,94399] 

Then the output should be = [94133,94133] [94200,94399]
